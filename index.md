As a Ph.D. student in applied probability at Mines Paris - PSL, I work on [physics-informed statistical modeling of earthquakes](.assets/files/physics-informed_statistical_modeling_earthquakes_.pdf) within their [Geosciences Center](https://www.geosciences.minesparis.psl.eu/en/home/). I am supervised by [Pierre Dublanchet](https://cv.hal.science/pierre-dublanchet). (Geophysics Team) and [Mike Pereira](https://mike-pereira.github.io/) (Geostatistics Team). I also assist the lecturers of the probability course in the 3rd year of bachelor's degree at Mines Paris - PSL.
